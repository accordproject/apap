<h1 id="accord-project-agreement-protocol">Accord Project Agreement Protocol</h1>
<p>The Accord Project Agreement Protocol (APAP) defines the protocol used between a document generation engine or contract management platform and an agreement server that provides agreement features such as: template management, document generation, format conversion etc.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-agreement-protocol%3F">What is the Agreement Protocol?</h2>
<p>Adding features like document generation, data format conversion for a document generation template language takes significant effort. Traditionally this work had to be repeated for each template format, as each format provides different APIs for implementing the same feature.</p>
<p>The APAP Agreement Server provides the template-specific smarts and communicate with agreement tools over a protocol that enables inter-process communication.</p>
<p>The Agreement Protocol (APAP) standardizes the protocol for how such servers and agreement tools communicate. This way, a single Agreement Server can be re-used in multiple agreement tools, which in turn can support multiple templates with minimal effort.</p>
<p>APAP is a win for both template providers and agreement tooling vendors!</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>
<p>An agreement server runs as a separate process and agreement tools communicate with the server using the agreement protocol over REST. Below is an example for how a tool and an agreement server communicate during a routine document generation session:</p>

<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>Not every agreement server can support all features defined by the protocol. APAP therefore provides ‘capabilities’. A capability groups a set of agreement features. An agreement tool and the agreement server announce their supported features using capabilities.</p>
<p>Notice the actual integration of an agreement server into a particular tool is not defined by the agreement protocol and is left to the tool implementors.</p>
